I am a professional educated at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia -university degree, master's degree and doctorate-. In the master's project I applied a control technique based on commutations to control the position and speed of a simple pendulum. In this project I used applied mathematics, switching-based control techniques, numerical methods, event-based programming, and MATLAB. In the doctoral project I developed a model for the adaptation of interaction devices for people with physical disabilities. The devices were built using the definition of usability according to the ISO 9241-11 standard, Computer Aided Design (CAD), 3D printing, CNC machines, embedded systems, sensors (e.g., inertial measurement units), and Bluetooth. Of course, I was lucky enough to lead a team of professionals who helped me to take advantage of these technologies. However, I programmed the embedded systems and Bluetooth utilizing C++.

Parallel to my doctorate, I participated in a project aimed at developing a system for measuring the functional capacity of the elderly. I coordinated an engineering team to design, implement and validate the devices. Another of my responsibilities was continuous communication with professionals from other areas of knowledge (health professionals, UX designers or mathematicians). As a complementary experience, I participated in the development of a mobile application for early warning of possible COVID-19 infections. I also had a short experience as a university professor of electronics and programming.

Currently, I develop software for the Colombian company Inference. The main languages I use in my work are C, C++ and Python. At the same time, I also use these languages as programming tools for my own projects and courses.
